# 3. Consent and Boundaries
	Player Boundaries: Some players may not be comfortable with certain themes. If a roleplay starts to make someone uncomfortable, back off.
	No Forcing RP: Do not force others into a scene or situation they clearly want to avoid. Consent applies both to physical and emotional roleplay.
