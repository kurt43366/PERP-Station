# 5. Combat and Antagonist Rules
	Creative Combat: Fighting is encouraged, but be creative! Find fun, inventive ways to harm, hinder, or humiliate others in-character.
	Antag Roles: Antagonists should aim to create interesting stories rather than mindlessly murder everyone. Create tension, but don’t ruin the fun by wiping out the entire station without cause. (Unless the admins whisper sweet nothings)
	No Griefing: Even as an antag, don't deliberately grief or destroy player enjoyment for the sake of it. It’s about roleplay, not mass destruction.
