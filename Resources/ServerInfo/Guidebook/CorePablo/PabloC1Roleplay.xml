# 1. Roleplay Is Key
	RP Focused: This is a roleplay-heavy server, so stay in character as much as possible. Build stories, relationships, and drama with other players.
	Creative Freedom: Go wild with your character.
	Avoid Metagaming: Do not use out-of-character knowledge to give your character an advantage in the game.
