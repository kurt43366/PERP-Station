# 4. Stay In-Character (IC) vs. Out-Of-Character (OOC)
	Keep IC Separate from OOC: Don’t break the immersion by going OOC unnecessarily. Use the proper channels for OOC conversations.
	OOC Respect: Disagreements in-game shouldn’t spill into OOC chat. Keep OOC chat respectful, fun, and free of drama.
